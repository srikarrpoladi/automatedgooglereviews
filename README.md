The Customer Review Analysis project is a data-driven application developed using Streamlit to analyze and derive insights from customer reviews. The application takes user-uploaded CSV files containing customer feedback, cleans the data, and performs sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. It provides visualizations for sentiment distribution and conducts word frequency analysis to identify common terms. Additionally, the app includes a topic modeling feature using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and aspect-based analysis to group reviews by predefined themes such as food, service, and ambiance. A unique feature of the app is its ability to extract and display frequent bigrams (two-word phrases) specific to each sentiment category, offering deeper insights into customer sentiment. The app also allows users to export the cleaned and processed dataset for further analysis, making it a comprehensive tool for understanding customer feedback and driving data-informed decision-making.
